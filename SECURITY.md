## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

Please do **not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. Instead, please use the **"Report a vulnerability"** button on the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/bobsilesia/oblamatik/security/advisories) page if available, or contact the maintainer directly via GitHub (e.g., mention in a generic issue asking for a private channel if unsure).

We will do our best to respond and address the issue promptly.
